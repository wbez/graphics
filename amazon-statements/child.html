                    <td data-title="Answer" class="comment">Rauner and Emanuel have presented a united front in their pursuit of Amazon. A commitment by the company to locate in Illinois would rank perhaps as the governor’s largest accomplishment in a stormy tenure with few legislative trophies, and it could become a cornerstone of his a 2018 re-election bid. 

<p>But an aide to the governor would not divulge details of the incentive package Rauner is helping shape. </p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be very good strategy to reveal our components – real or philosophical – to other competitors before we submit the bid. That said, we will make the components public at the appropriate time,” Rauner spokesman Hud Englehart told WBEZ in an emailed statement. </p>

                    <td data-title="Answer" class="comment">The billionaire founder of Chicago’s 1871 tech incubator at the Merchandise Mart believes Illinois can offer Amazon a mix of workforce training incentives, business tax credits, and temporary property tax reductions. But he stopped short of putting a value on how large a package might need to be to persuade Amazon to locate here. 

<p>Pritzker does not believe the state’s dire finances inhibit Illinois’ ability to compete for the company. </p>

<p>“Can we afford to make an investment that has real returns for the taxpayers of Illinois? Of course we can,” he told WBEZ. </p>

<p>Pritzker did not voice a preference for any of the potential sites being offered up to Amazon, but he said areas that are not chosen to host the company should still share in its benefits. Pritzker’s sister, former U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker, is part of a committee of business leaders assembled by Rauner and Emanuel to lobby Amazon to come to Illinois.</p>

A possible $3 billion offering to Amazon, akin to what Wisconsin gave Foxconn to build a $10 billion manufacturing complex, yields “sticker shock” to him, and Biss believes Amazon must agree to relinquish state subsides if it falls short of job quotas.</p><p>“Amazon is one of the largest and apparently now the most durable financial entities in the history of the human race so there will be plenty to claw back,” he said.</p></td>

                    <td data-title="Answer" class="comment">The son of former U.S. Sen. Robert Kennedy believes Illinois should move “full steam ahead” in its pursuit of Amazon, but voiced wariness about how fast — and how secretive — the negotiations around Amazon have been so far.<p>“I wouldn’t be afraid of spending $3 billion if I got $10 billion back, but I don’t know how we’re measuring these results and who’s providing oversight. This thing is moving fast, and when things move fast, we should be scared,” the Democrat told WBEZ. </p>
<p>Any incentive package requires robust public input, and Illinois should avoid signing onto a deal that could take 25 years to pay for itself, he said.

                    <td data-title="Answer" class="comment">The Democratic alderman from Chicago’s 47th Ward believes there should be a commitment by the state to engineer a deal with Amazon that matches every public dollar in business subsidies with an equal investment for public infrastructure, public schools, and universities. Overall, Pawar is skeptical of any “massive tax break” to Amazon. 

<p>“Everyone is willing to throw themselves at a HQ2 because of the splashy headlines and the job numbers when we know, based on our own history here in Illinois, whether it’s Sears or any other tax credit that we’ve offered, that the jobs numbers, the economic development numbers have just never panned out the way they were promised,” he told WBEZ. </p>

<p>If the state does offer subsidies to Amazon, he believes the company should be compelled to build in “parts of the city that have been left behind.”</p>

He expressed opposition to any form of refundable state payroll tax credits or commitment of state infrastructure dollars to Amazon. He also expressed a preference that the company move its headquarters to East St. Louis, Chicago’s West or South Sides, or somewhere in the south suburbs.</td>
