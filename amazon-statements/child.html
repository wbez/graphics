I have never and will never support a religious test to enter this country. That goes against the very belief on which our nation was founded. But people are kidding themselves if they think our current ‘vetting’ processes for refugees are not leaving our country open to terrorist attacks like we’ve seen in Europe. The director of the FBI and other officials under Obama said they’re not properly vetting refugees coming to the U.S. This Executive Order, while in need of tailoring and better communication to lower departments handling the directive, simply pauses visas for refugees from seven terrorist hotspots to give them time to put more secure policies in place. There are many more predominantly Muslim countries that this order does not impact. This is similar to what the Obama administration did in 2011 when they paused visas for refugees from Iraq for six months," said in a statement.</td>
