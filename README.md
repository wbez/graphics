# WBEZ Graphics

## What's in here
This repo holds the code for graphics created with WBEZ's version of [NPR's daily graphics rig](https://github.com/nprapps/dailygraphics). Production versions of these graphics will live in the wbez-dailygraphics bucket on S3, with staged versions in wbez-stage-dailygraphics.

## Why a repo for graphics
This not only a place for published graphics to live but a repository of past graphic templates for later use and sharing within the organization.
