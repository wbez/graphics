headline,Percentage of Chicago Public Schools student population by race
subhed,"Starting in 2010, Latino students overtook African-American students as the largest student group in the district.  But this change is not due to an increase of Latino students, but rather, a loss of African-American students. The district had 36 percent fewer black students in 2016 than it did in 2000."
