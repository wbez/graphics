                <p> Drury promised to bring criminal charges against officers. Historically, the attorney general in Illinois has focused more on consumer protection than criminal prosecutions. </p><p>“You need to send the message that [misconduct is] not going to be tolerated,” Drury said. “I know that the people in Illinois have become comfortable with this notion that the attorney general can’t do criminal investigations, but I believe that is a very active question, and certainly one that I am going to look into and test when I am in office.”</p>

                <p> Fairley said there needs to be a statewide agency responsible for reviewing police shootings that goes beyond the current system, which only involves a criminal investigation. For that to work, she said, the state needs uniform guidelines for when an officer can use lethal force. Fairley also said the attorney general’s office can “really help” by offering training and other assistance to smaller departments facing funding shortages. </p> <p> “We need to use policy to raise the level so that we are authorizing officers to use force under circumstances that we as a community believe are appropriate,” she said.</p>

                <p> Harold said she is looking at two options: To advocate for the Illinois General Assembly to expand a 2015 law so police shootings are reviewed for things beyond criminality, and to create an agency similar to Chicago’s Civilian Office of Police Accountability to investigate police shootings in the suburbs. She said she is still “exploring which direction” would be accepted by relevant stakeholders, like suburban police chiefs and city leaders, and “bring about concrete changes most quickly and effectively.”</p><p>“The attorney general has to work in tandem with other stakeholders … and it’s important to not only propose laws that the general assembly will hopefully adopt, but also see if there’s another structure that can bring about change within the suburban police departments as well,” she said.</p>

“If people don’t trust their police, they aren’t gonna go to them and be witnesses in cases. They aren’t gonna cooperate with the police. So it’s something that has a big impact for a limited cost,” he said.
