STEPS TO CREATE CHART

* Create all container elements and attach to DOM
* Set widths and heights
* Create default states/functions for all lines, axes and scales
	- This includes ranges but not domains
* Create color scale
	- This may need to be done manually with variable names

UPDATE FUNCTION
* Takes state as variable, uses that to get correct config values
* Remakes lines and axes based on config
* Updates state
