"}, {"slide": "users", "head": "Where the users are", "text": "OkCupid has more users in North Side ZIP codes around areas like Logan Square and Lincoln Park. That, in part, explains why you see so many messages sent to users in those areas."}, {"slide": "howto", "head": "Reading the map", "text": "When a ZIP code is highlighted, the map changes to show the areas that users within that ZIP code message the most."}, {"slide": "logan", "head": "People message people nearby", "text": "People show a preference for messaging others near them. For example, in the 60647 ZIP code around Logan Square, 10 percent of all messages stay within the ZIP code. "}, {"slide": "lincoln", "head": "People message people along their CTA line", "text": "Users also tended to message people in ZIP codes along their 'L' line. For example, Lakeview residents more frequently message those in neighborhoods directly north and south of them along the Red Line."}, {"slide": "southside", "head": "The South Side", "text": "Once you go south of Englewood, you see a big shift in preference for nearby neighborhoods. North Side ZIP codes like Logan Square's still light up. However, that is likely due (at least in part) to the large population of OkCupid users in that area. Messages to South Side neighborhoods are still most likely to come from other South Side neighborhoods. "}, {"slide": "race", "head": "The impact of race", "text": "Forty-six percent of OkCupid users in Chicago did not provide their racial background. However, race is likely an additional factor in neighborhood messaging patterns. Chicago neighborhoods are segregated by race and research shows that race has a strong influence on dating choices."}, {"slide": "hydepark", "head": "Hyde Park ", "text": "Hyde Park is an outlier on the South Side, showing a strong messaging preference for North Side neighborhoods. It's likely this has to do, at least in part, with age demographics."}, {"slide": "hydepark2", "head": "Hyde Park ", "text": "Hyde Park has a younger population than Chicago and surrounding South Side neighborhoods due to University of Chicago students. The North Side neighborhoods that Hyde Park users message most, like Lakeview and Logan Square, also have younger populations than the city's average.
